## Overview

DynamicsLab simulates rigid body dynamics using a range of constraints (ball joints, distance constraints, revolute joints, spherical joints, and universal joints) combined with an implicit integration scheme and constraint stabilization. The project is built with C++20 and leverages modern libraries for mathematics, graphics, and UI.

## Architecture

DynamicsLab is structured into several modular components:

- **Core System:**  
  - **Application:** Manages initialization, the main loop, and shutdown procedures.  
  - **Context:** Provides centralized access to window, input, rendering, scene, UI, and timing systems.

- **Rendering & Input:**  
  - **WindowManager & InputManager:** Create and manage the application window and handle user input.  
  - **Renderer & ShaderManager:** Manage OpenGL state, shader compilation, and drawing of simulation elements.  
  - **ImGuiManager:** Integrates ImGui for UI overlays and debugging information.

- **Scene Management:**  
  - **SceneManager & Primary Scene:** Organize simulation scenes and handle per-frame updates, camera controls, and UI interactions.

- **Physics Engine:**  
  - **Dynamics & Body:** Represent and simulate rigid bodies with mass, inertia, and state updates.  
  - **Constraints:** Implement various constraints (ball joint, distance, revolute, spherical, universal) for realistic motion.  
  - **Force Generators:** Apply forces such as gravity, spring forces, and torque to the bodies.

## Features

- **Multi-Body Dynamics Simulation:**  
  Solve rigid body dynamics with constraint projection and stabilization techniques.

- **Constraint Support:**  
  Implement various joint types (ball, distance, revolute, spherical, universal) using analytical Jacobians.

- **Modular and Extensible Design:**  
  Separate systems for rendering, input, physics, and UI for easy maintenance and extension.

- **Real-Time Rendering:**  
  Leverage OpenGL with GLFW, GLAD, and GLM for high-performance graphics.

- **Interactive UI:**  
  Integrated ImGui interface for runtime diagnostics and simulation control.
